## My Story
I would normally play myself down in a profile like this, but since I'm trying to get hired, I'm going to tout all of my proudest achievements here. I went to undergrad school at St. John's University, where I double-majored in ACS Chemistry and Math.  In 2001, I graduated magna cum laude.

From there, I was most interested in quantum mechanics, so I went to graduate school in computational chemistry at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.  In my interview for the school, I was told that I had incorrectly applied directly to the Ph.D. program and should have applied to the Master's degree program first.  However, my academic record to that point was so strong that my interviewer waived the requirement and accepted me directly into the Ph.D. track.  (That was an exciting moment!)

After completing my coursework (with a 4.0) and comprehensive exam at UBC, I discovered that I preferred working with people more than information, and computational chemistry is not a people-drive track!  I had also developed a passion for personal finance and I discovered that ING Direct--arguably the biggest growth success story in the history of banking--had a major operations center in my hometown.  I took an entry level sales job in their call center and soon established myself as a top salesperson.

I was promoted to mortgage sales, where I brought my data analysis skills to bear by making a tool that performed risk analyses.  I gave this to the salespeople on my team and it allowed them to take the fear out of adjustable-rate-mortgages (in other words, we sold a ton of loans with this tool).

I was then promoted to assistant coach on a sales team.  That year, I received the company's assistant coach of the year award and was promoted to coach.  I had a team of two assistants and 20 salespeople.  We ranked consistently high on the sales charts.

My final position with ING Direct was to pilot a new team called the "loan specialists."  Our job was to provide customer service for all of ING Direct's mortgages in-process (nationally).  Under my leadership, the company's survey-measured customer satisfaction rate rose to an all-time high of 95%.

It was at this point that I realized that I loved teaching.  After all, my job at ING Direct was to teach my team members to be the best they could be.  I missed computing and science, and I ultimately became a high school chemistry teacher.  There was no computing teacher at the time, so I created curriculum, got school board approval, and recruited students for 5 new computing courses.  Those courses are now offered at all of the high schools in my district.  I also founded the [Apollo Climbing Club](https://apolloclimbing.rocks).

After ten years of teaching, I'm ready for a new challenge. I will find a position where my leadership and communication abilities are utilized as much as my technical problem-solving ability.
